# Finishing Up the Header Styling

In this section, weâ€™ll complete the styling of our header and navigation bar by refining spacing, font styles, and active link indicators.

By the end of this section, your header will look balanced, neatly aligned, and visually consistent.

---

## Step 1: Adjust the Heading Font Weight and Size

Letâ€™s begin by improving the appearance of the main heading (`<h1>`).  
By default, any `<h1>` element has a **font-weight of 700** (bold).

You can adjust its **font-weight** and **font-size** to better match your websiteâ€™s design.

```css
h1 {
  font-weight: 300; /* Default is 700, but you can customize */

}
```

> You can experiment with different sizes to find what fits your layout best.

---

## Step 2: Adjust Header Spacing and Margins

When you preview your page, youâ€™ll notice extra space above and below your `<h1>` element.  
This is because `<h1>` elements have **default browser margins** applied.

Weâ€™ll handle spacing by applying the margin to the **header** instead of the `<h1>`, giving us better control of overall layout.

Hereâ€™s the updated HTML:

```html
<header class="navbar">
  <h1>OptiFoodPhotography</h1>
  <nav class="nav-links">
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#home">Home</a></li>
      <li><a href="#services">Services</a></li>
      <li><a href="#contact">Contact</a></li>
    </ul>
  </nav>
</header>
```

Now, letâ€™s add some CSS:

```css
.navbar {
  margin: 32px;
}

h1 {
  display: inline-block;
  margin: 0; /* Remove default browser margin */
}
```

This centers your spacing control within the `.navbar` class while keeping the heading aligned.

---

## Step 3: Remove Default `ul` Padding

When inspecting your page in **DevTools**, you may notice green-highlighted padding around the `<ul>` element.  
Thatâ€™s because browsers apply **default padding** to lists (to indent them slightly).

Weâ€™ll reset that padding manually for now:

```css
.nav-links ul {
  padding: 0;
}
```

> Later in the course, weâ€™ll learn how to **reset all browser default styles** in one go using a CSS reset or `normalize.css`.

---

## Step 4: Add Space Between the Title and Navigation Links

To visually separate the `<h1>` from the navigation links, weâ€™ll add some margin to the right of the heading.

```css
h1 {
  display: inline-block;
  margin: 0 32px;
}
```

This creates about **32px of spacing** between the logo/title and the start of the navigation links.

> In professional settings, spacing is usually defined by a **UI designer**, but when designing yourself, you can experiment to find a balanced look.

---

## Step 5: Indicate the Active Page Link

Next, weâ€™ll show users which page theyâ€™re currently on.  
We can do this by **underlining** the active link.

HTML:

```html
<li><a class="active-navlink" href="#home">Home</a></li>
```

CSS:

```css
a.active-navlink {
  text-decoration: underline;
}
```

---

### Why `.active-navlink` Alone Doesnâ€™t Work

You might have tried this and noticed it didnâ€™t work:

```css
.active-navlink {
  text-decoration: underline;
}
```

Thatâ€™s because itâ€™s being **overridden** by this earlier rule:

```css
.nav-links a {
  color: black;
  text-decoration: none;
  font-size: 20px;
  margin: 0 15px;
}
```

The reason? **CSS specificity.**

`a.active-navlink` is more specific than `.active-navlink`, so it overrides the more general rule successfully.

Weâ€™ll explore CSS specificity in depth later, but for now, just remember:

> The more specific selector (like `a.active-navlink`) takes priority.

---

## Step 6: Use Border Instead of Text Decoration

While `text-decoration: underline;` works, using a **border-bottom** gives you more styling flexibility.

You can:

- Adjust **thickness**
- Control **color**
- Create more **space** between text and line

```css
a.active-navlink {
  border-bottom: 2px solid black;
  padding-bottom: 4px;
}
```

This gives your navbar a more polished and modern look.
